# Apogee — Milestones

The **record of finished work** — completed items move here out of [`backlog/`](../backlog/README.md) (the work queue) so the backlog holds only what's left. This is history and reference: what shipped and how it was built. The release-level board (which version each theme landed in) is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); the architecture reference is in [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md).

Milestones are grouped by feature area and lettered. Each entry gives the user-facing **Goal**, a checklist of what was built, and a **Notes** line for trade-offs.

When a backlog item ships, **fold** it into the matching milestone here (extend the checklist, or add a dated `###` subsection for a substantial addition) rather than starting a new one, unless it's a genuinely new area — and delete its backlog document per the docs flow. Detail is welcome — this is where "how it was built" is preserved alongside the code and git history.

## Milestone A — Project foundation

**Goal.** Turn a docs-only repository into a buildable, testable C++ project, so every later item lands inside a working skeleton instead of inventing one. Nothing about the toolchain had been decided; this milestone forces those decisions where they are cheapest and wires the disciplines that only work if they exist from the first line of code.

### 2026-08-25 — C++ project skeleton (CMake, tests, CI, CLI scaffold)

**What was built**

- [x] **App-owned CMake build.** `lib/src/cli/` is a self-contained CMake project: build root, presets, `Makefile`, `cmake/` helpers, `third_party/`, and style config all live beside the code. Nothing above `lib/src/<app>/` knows how that application compiles, so the GUI apps can land later as siblings without touching a shared build.
- [x] **Library-first split, enforced.** `apogee_core` (static library — every capability) and `apogee` (a thin argv→exit-code face). `cmake/ApogeeLinkPolicy.cmake` walks every target at configure time and fails the build if anything links the executable. Tests link the library only.
- [x] **Seven CMake presets** — `default` plus one named exactly after each of the six release targets, building into `build/<preset>/`, the path `cicd.sh` selects by.
- [x] **`lib/scripts/cicd.sh` builds for real.** It gained an `APPS` list and now drives each application's own CMake project; the pre-existing docs-only notice is gone. CI invokes this same script per native runner, so there is one build path everywhere.
- [x] **Catch2 v3 suite, 30 tests via ctest** — version stamping, dependency wiring, the platform seam, command registration, and the real parsing path. Plus `cli.*` cases that run the built binary as a subprocess, covering the contract as a user meets it.
- [x] **CLI scaffold with self-registration.** `Command` interface + `CommandRegistry` + `RootCommand`, persistent `--config`, and `apogee version` as the first real subcommand. Adding a command touches its own two files and one line in `default_registry()`; `main.cpp` never grows.
- [x] **The portability seam** (`source/platform/`) — the one place platform `#ifdef`s are expected, exposing the build's OS, architecture, and release-target name. An unrecognized platform is a compile error, not a silent "unknown".
- [x] **Reserved package headers** for `harness/`, `backends/`, `agentloop/`, `embedstore/`, `httpserver/`, `mcp/` — each documenting what lands there and which item fills it, each included by `packages_test.cpp` so a broken include path surfaces immediately.
- [x] **llama.cpp pinned** to commit `549b9d84` (the revision Ommi's local-inference path builds against), off by default, verified to compile as a linked library target with Metal on macOS arm64.
- [x] **Formatting and the ownership gate.** `.clang-format` + `.clang-tidy`; `make lint` fails on a raw `new`/`delete`, an owning raw pointer, or `malloc`. Verified in both directions with a deliberately violating fixture (exit code 2 with it, 0 without), then removed.
- [x] **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — six-target matrix, a format+lint job, a non-blocking llama.cpp compile proof, and a clean-room fresh-clone build.

**Decisions**

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| C++ standard | **C++20** | The backlog item defaulted to "C++23 if the toolchain proves stable" on the strength of `#embed` — but `#embed` is a **C23/C++26** feature, not C++23, so the rationale did not hold. C++20 is uniformly supported across all six targets and is a one-line promotion later; retreating from C++23 after Windows CI turns red would not be. |
| Dependencies | FetchContent + `FIND_PACKAGE_ARGS` + `SYSTEM` | One mechanism. System copies win when present, network fetch is the fallback, and third-party headers are not held to Apogee's warning bar. |
| Test framework | Catch2 v3 | Item default. |
| JSON / CLI / HTTP | nlohmann/json, CLI11, **libcurl** | Standardized once, project-wide. JSON and CLI11 are wired; libcurl is the standing pick but deliberately **not** wired until `anthropic-backend` needs it, so the skeleton builds on hosts without a curl development package. |
| Makefile | Kept, thin | Delegates to `cicd.sh`; it may never become load-bearing. |
| CI gating | **macos-arm64 blocking; the other five informational** | User decision. The codebase is one commit old and Windows portability has not started; targets get promoted to blocking by deleting a `continue-on-error` line. |

**Notes.** The `apogee` binary prints help on a bare invocation and exits 0 — running it with no arguments is a question, not a usage error. Two traps cost real time and are now recorded in DEVELOPER.md: a Catch2 test name may not begin with `-` (ctest passes it as an argument), and `#` is not a comment inside `.clang-tidy`'s `Checks:` folded block — it silently becomes a bogus check name and disables every entry after it. `make lint` also configures its own build directory using the compiler from clang-tidy's own directory, because Homebrew's clang-tidy cannot find Apple clang's libc++ and fails every file with a misleading `'cstddef' file not found`.

Two things this milestone deliberately did **not** do: wire libcurl (above), and enable llama.cpp on the per-push path — its Metal/CUDA build is slow, and a separate non-blocking job catches a pin that stops compiling without taxing every change.
